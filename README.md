# Questions and Answers

### Q1. What is JavaScript?
   - JavaScript is a versatile programming language primarily known for its role in web development.
   - It is a high-level, interpreted scripting language that allows developers to add dynamic and interactive elements to websites.
   - [Back to Top](#javascript-interview-questions)

### Q2. Explain the difference between `let`, `const`, and `var` in JavaScript. 
   - **`let`:** It allows the declaration of block-scoped variables. The variable can be reassigned within the same block.
   - **`const`:** It also declares block-scoped variables but is used for constants that cannot be reassigned.
   - **`var`:** It declares a variable globally or locally to the entire function, regardless of block scope. It can be reassigned.
   - Example:
        ```
        function testVar() {
     if (true) {
    var x = 1;
     }
     console.log(x); // 1 (var is function-scoped)
      }

      function testLet() {
     if (true) {
    let y = 2;
     }
     // console.log(y); // Error! y is block-scoped
      }

      const z = 3;
      // z = 4; // Error! Cannot re-assign const

        ```

### Q3. What is the DOM in JavaScript?
   - The DOM (Document Object Model) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content dynamically.
   - The DOM represents the document as a tree of nodes, where each node corresponds to part of the page (e.g., elements, attributes, text).
   - [Back to Top](#javascript-interview-questions)

### Q4. Explain the concept of closures in JavaScript.
   - A closure allows a function to remember and access variables from its outer scope even after the outer function has completed execution.
   - For example, if I define a function inside another function, the inner function forms a closure over the outer function’s variables. This is powerful for scenarios like data privacy, counters, and factory functions.
   - [Back to Top](#javascript-interview-questions)

### Q5. How does prototypal inheritance work in JavaScript?
   - JavaScript uses prototypal inheritance, where objects can inherit properties and methods from other objects.
   - Each object has an internal property called `[[Prototype]]`, and when a property is not found in an object, JavaScript looks for it in the object's prototype, creating a chain.
   - In classical inheritance, classes are immutable, may or may not support multiple inheritance, and may contain interfaces, final classes, and abstract classes. In contrast, prototypes are much more flexible in the sense that they may be mutable or immutable. The object
may inherit from multiple prototypes, and only contains objects.

### Q6. What is asynchronous programming in JavaScript?
   - Asynchronous programming in JavaScript allows code to run without waiting for long-running tasks to finish.
   - Asynchronous programming is a technique that enables your program to start a potentially long-running task and still be able to be responsive to other events while that task runs, rather than having to wait until that task has finished. Once that task has finished, your program is presented with the result.

### Q7. Explain the difference between `==` and `===` in JavaScript. 
   - **`==`:** It performs type coercion, allowing different types to be considered equal. For example, `"5" == 5` is true.
   - **`===`:** It strictly checks for equality without type coercion. `"5" === 5` is false.
   - [Back to Top](#javascript-interview-questions)

### Q8. What are Arrow functions in JavaScript?
   - Arrow function {()=>} is concise way of writing JavaScript functions in shorter way. They make our code more structured and readable.
   - Arrow functions are anonymous functions i.e. functions without a name but they are often assigned to any variable. They are also called Lambda Functions.
   - [Back to Top](#javascript-interview-questions)

### Q9. What is the significance of the `this` keyword in JavaScript?
   - The `this` keyword refers to the object it belongs to. In a function, `this` refers to the global object (window in a browser).
   - In methods, `this` refers to the object that owns the method. Arrow functions don't have their own `this` but inherit it from the enclosing scope.

### q10-explain-the-callback-promises-async-await-in-javascript.
   - **Callback** :
   - A callback is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is executed after the outer function completes its task.
   - It is one of the earliest ways JavaScript handled asynchronous operations (like reading a file, API calls, etc.).
   - **Promises** :
   - A Promise is an object that represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.
   - promise has three states:
     1. Pending: This is the initial stage. Nothing happens here. Think of it like this, your customer is taking their time giving you an order. But they haven't ordered anything yet.
     2. Resolved: This means that your customer has received their food and is happy.
     3. Rejected: This means that your customer didn't receive their order and left the restaurant.
   - **Aysnc** :
   - The Async function simply allows us to write promises-based code as if it were synchronous and it checks that we are not breaking the execution thread.
   - Async functions will always return a value. It makes sure that a promise is returned and if it is not returned then JavaScript automatically wraps it in a promise which is resolved with its value.
   - **Await** :
   - Await is used to wait for the promise. It could be used within the async block only.It makes the code wait until the promise returns a result.

### Q11. What is the purpose of the `setTimeout` function in JavaScript?
   - The `setTimeout` function is used to delay the execution of a function or a piece of code for a specified amount of time (in milliseconds).
   - It's commonly used to create delays in animations, execute code after a certain interval, or simulate asynchronous behavior.
   - [Back to Top](#javascript-interview-questions)

### Q12. How can you handle errors in JavaScript?
   - Errors in JavaScript can be handled using `try`, `catch`, `finally` blocks.
   - The `try` block contains the code to be executed, and if an error occurs, it jumps to the `catch` block.
   - The `finally` block is executed regardless of whether an error occurred or not.
   - [Back to Top](#javascript-interview-questions)

### Q13. What is an event loop in JavaScript?

JavaScript’s event loop is the core mechanism that enables asynchronous operations. Although JavaScript is single-threaded, it manages tasks efficiently. Imagine it as a queue system: events such as user interactions or network requests are added to the queue, and the engine processes them one by one. This allows JavaScript to handle non-blocking tasks without freezing, keeping the application responsive even while waiting for data or other operations.

**How does the event loop work?**

- **Call Stack:**
    - JavaScript uses a call stack to keep track of the currently executing function (where the program is in its execution).
  
- **Callback Queue:**
    - Asynchronous operations, such as I/O operations or timers, are handled by the browser or Node.js runtime. When these operations are complete, corresponding functions (callbacks) are placed in the callback queue.
  
- **Event Loop:**
    - The event loop continuously checks the call stack and the callback queue. If the call stack is empty, it takes the first function from the callback queue and pushes it onto the call stack for execution.
  
- **Execution:**
    - The function on top of the call stack is executed. If this function contains asynchronous code, it might initiate further asynchronous operations.
  
- **Callback Execution:**
    - When an asynchronous operation is complete, its callback is placed in the callback queue.
  
- **Repeat:**
    - The event loop continues this process, ensuring that the call stack is always empty before taking the next function from the callback queue.

### Q14. What is the difference between `null` and `undefined` in JavaScript?
   - **`null`:** It represents the intentional absence of any object value. It must be assigned.
   - **`undefined`:** It represents an uninitialized or unassigned value. Variables that are not assigned a value are `undefined`.
   - [Back to Top](#javascript-interview-questions)

### Q15. What is Map, Filter, Reduce?
   - **Map** :
   - The map() method is used for creating a new array from an existing one, applying a function to each one of the elements of the first array.
   - n the callback, only the array element is required. Usually some action is performed on the value and then a new value is returned.
   - **Filter** :
   - The filter() method takes each element in an array and it applies a conditional statement against it. If this conditional returns true, the element gets pushed to the output array. If the condition returns false, the element does not get pushed to the output array.
   - The syntax for filter is similar to map, except the callback function should return true to keep the element, or false otherwise. In the callback, only the element is required.
   - **Reduce** :
   - The reduce() method reduces an array of values down to just one value. To get the output value, it runs a reducer function on each element of the array.
   - The callback argument is a function that will be called once for every item in the array. This function takes four arguments, but often only the first two are used.

### Q16. Explain the concept of hoisting in JavaScript.
   - Hoisting is a JavaScript behavior where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope during the compilation phase.
   - Variables declared with `var` are hoisted and initialized with `undefined`. Function declarations are fully hoisted.
   - [Back to Top](#javascript-interview-questions)

### Q17. What is the role of the `document.write()` method?
   - The `document.write()` method is used to write HTML expressions or JavaScript code to a document.
   - It is typically used for testing and dynamically generating content, but it can cause issues with the document structure if used after the page has loaded.
   - [Back to Top](#javascript-interview-questions)

### Q18. How does the `localStorage` differ from `sessionStorage` in JavaScript?
   - **`localStorage`:** Data stored in `localStorage` persists even after the browser is closed. It has no expiration time.
   - **`sessionStorage`:** Data stored in `sessionStorage` is limited to the duration of the page session. It is cleared when the page session ends.
   - [Back to Top](#javascript-interview-questions)

### Q19. What is the difference between SQL and NoSQL databases?
   **SQL Databases:**
- **Schema-based:** SQL databases use a predefined schema, which includes table structures, relationships, and data types.
- **Structured data:** They are ideal for handling structured data that follows a strict format.
- **Relational model:** These databases use tables to represent data, with relationships between tables maintained using foreign keys.
- **ACID compliance:** SQL databases are known for their support of ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability), which ensures data integrity.
- **Query language:** SQL databases use Structured Query Language (SQL) for querying and manipulating data.
- **Examples:** MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server.

**NoSQL Databases:**
- **Flexible schema:** NoSQL databases do not require a predefined schema, allowing for flexibility in handling different data types and structures.
- **Unstructured data:** They are suitable for managing unstructured or semi-structured data, such as JSON or XML.
- **Various data models:** NoSQL databases offer different data models, including key-value stores, document stores, column-family stores, and graph databases.
- **Scalability:** NoSQL databases are often more scalable and can handle large amounts of data across distributed systems.
- **BASE properties:** Instead of ACID, NoSQL databases prioritize BASE properties (Basically Available, Soft state, Eventual consistency) for distributed systems.
- **Examples:** MongoDB, Cassandra, CouchDB, Redis, Neo4j.

In summary, SQL databases are suitable for structured data and require a predefined schema, whereas NoSQL databases offer flexibility in handling unstructured data and can be more scalable. The choice between SQL and NoSQL depends on the specific requirements of your application.

### Q20. What are debouncing and throttling in JavaScript?

**Debouncing:**
Debouncing is a technique used to limit the execution of a function call. It delays the execution of the function until after a certain period of time has passed since the last function call. If the function is called again before the delay period is over, the timer resets and the function execution is postponed. This can be useful in scenarios such as handling input events, where you want to wait for the user to stop typing before processing their input.

**Throttling:**
Throttling is a technique used to limit the execution of an event handler function to a specific rate. It ensures that the function is executed at most once in a given period of time, even if the event occurs multiple times. This is beneficial in scenarios such as handling browser resizing or scrolling events, where continuous execution can cause performance issues.

By using debouncing and throttling, you can optimize your code for better performance and avoid unnecessary function calls.

### Q21. Explain `call()`, `apply()`, and `bind()` methods in JavaScript.
   - In JavaScript, `call()`, `apply()`, and `bind()` are methods used to manipulate the context (the value of `this`) in which a function is executed.

   - **`call()` method:**
     - The `call()` method is used to invoke a function with a specific `this` value and arguments provided individually.

   - **`apply()` method:**
     - The `apply()` method is similar to `call()`, but it takes an array of arguments instead of listing them individually.

   - **`bind()` method:**
     - The `bind()` method creates a new function that, when called, has its `this` keyword set to a specific value, and returns a bound function.

### Q22. What is Node.js? What are its advantages and disadvantages?

**Node.js** is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to build server-side and network applications using JavaScript. It is built on the V8 JavaScript engine developed by Google and is known for its event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, which makes it efficient and suitable for scalable applications.

**Advantages of Node.js:**
- **Asynchronous and Event-Driven:** Node.js is based on an asynchronous, non-blocking I/O model that makes it suitable for handling concurrent requests efficiently.
- **Single Language for Both Server and Client:** Since it uses JavaScript, developers can write both server-side and client-side code in the same language, making it easier to maintain and share code.
- **Large Ecosystem:** Node.js has a large ecosystem of packages and libraries available through npm (Node Package Manager), making it easier to find and integrate tools and modules.
- **Fast Performance:** Being built on the V8 engine, Node.js offers high-speed execution and performance.
- **Community Support:** Node.js has a large and active community, providing plenty of support, resources, and continuous improvements.

**Disadvantages of Node.js:**
- **Single-threaded:** While Node.js uses a non-blocking I/O model, it operates as a single-threaded environment, which can lead to performance issues when handling CPU-intensive tasks.
- **Callback Hell:** Due to its asynchronous nature, complex operations may lead to "callback hell," where callbacks are nested deeply, making code harder to read and maintain.
- **Not Suitable for Heavy Computation:** Node.js is not well-suited for heavy computation tasks as it may block the event loop, affecting application performance.
- **Immature Modules:** Some npm modules may not be well-maintained or fully reliable, so careful selection and testing are necessary.

Overall, Node.js is an excellent choice for building scalable and efficient web applications and APIs, particularly when handling many concurrent connections or dealing with real-time data. However, it may not be the best choice for CPU-intensive applications or scenarios requiring heavy computation.

### Q25. What are SQL joins?

In SQL, joins are used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them. This allows you to retrieve data from multiple tables in a single query, making it easier to analyze data and gain insights. Here are some common types of SQL joins:

1. **INNER JOIN:**
    - Retrieves rows that have matching values in both tables based on the specified join condition.
    - Example:
        ```sql
        SELECT columns
        FROM table1
        INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.column = table2.column;
        ```

2. **LEFT JOIN (LEFT OUTER JOIN):**
    - Retrieves all rows from the left table and matching rows from the right table. If there is no match, NULL values are returned for columns from the right table.
    - Example:
        ```sql
        SELECT columns
        FROM table1
        LEFT JOIN table2 ON table1.column = table2.column;
        ```

3. **RIGHT JOIN (RIGHT OUTER JOIN):**
    - Retrieves all rows from the right table and matching rows from the left table. If there is no match, NULL values are returned for columns from the left table.
    - Example:
        ```sql
        SELECT columns
        FROM table1
        RIGHT JOIN table2 ON table1.column = table2.column;
        ```

4. **FULL OUTER JOIN:**
    - Retrieves all rows from both tables, including rows with no matching values. If there is no match, NULL values are returned for columns from the non-matching table.
    - Example:
        ```sql
        SELECT columns
        FROM table1
        FULL OUTER JOIN table2 ON table1.column = table2.column;
        ```

5. **CROSS JOIN:**
    - Produces a Cartesian product of both tables, resulting in all possible combinations of rows from each table.
    - Example:
        ```sql
        SELECT columns
        FROM table1
        CROSS JOIN table2;
        ```

6. **SELF JOIN:**
    - Joins a table to itself, typically for hierarchical or related data within a single table.
    - Example:
        ```sql
        SELECT columns
        FROM table1 AS t1
        JOIN table1 AS t2 ON t1.column = t2.column;
        ```

Using joins, you can create complex queries to retrieve and combine data from multiple tables efficiently. Joins are essential for querying relational databases and are a fundamental aspect of SQL. Let me know if you have any other questions or if there's anything else I can help you with!
