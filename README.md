# Questions and Answers

### Q1. What is JavaScript?
   - JavaScript is a versatile programming language primarily known for its role in web development.
   - It is a high-level, interpreted scripting language that allows developers to add dynamic and interactive elements to websites.

### Q2. Explain the difference between `let`, `const`, and `var` in JavaScript. 
   - **`let`:** It allows the declaration of block-scoped variables. The variable can be reassigned within the same block.
   - **`const`:** It also declares block-scoped variables but is used for constants that cannot be reassigned.
   - **`var`:** It declares a variable globally or locally to the entire function, regardless of block scope. It can be reassigned.

### Q3. What is the DOM in JavaScript?
   - The DOM (Document Object Model) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content dynamically.
   - The DOM represents the document as a tree of nodes, where each node corresponds to part of the page (e.g., elements, attributes, text).

### Q4. Explain the concept of closures in JavaScript.
   - A closure is a function along with its lexical environment (the environment in which the function was declared). It allows a function to access variables from its outer function even after that function has finished execution.
   - Closures are useful for maintaining state, creating private variables, and implementing data encapsulation.

### Q5. How does prototypal inheritance work in JavaScript?
   - JavaScript uses prototypal inheritance, where objects can inherit properties and methods from other objects.
   - Each object has an internal property called `[[Prototype]]`, and when a property is not found in an object, JavaScript looks for it in the object's prototype, creating a chain.

### Q6. What is asynchronous programming in JavaScript?
   - Asynchronous programming in JavaScript allows code to run without waiting for long-running tasks to finish.
   - It is achieved using callbacks, promises, and async/await. Callbacks are functions passed as arguments to be executed later.

### Q7. Explain the difference between `==` and `===` in JavaScript.
   - **`==`:** It performs type coercion, allowing different types to be considered equal. For example, `"5" == 5` is true.
   - **`===`:** It strictly checks for equality without type coercion. `"5" === 5` is false.

### Q8. What are Arrow functions in JavaScript?
   - Arrow functions are a concise way to write function expressions in JavaScript.
   - They have a shorter syntax, lexically bind `this`, and don't have their own `this`, `arguments`, `super`, or `new.target`.
   - [Back to Top](#javascript-interview-questions)

### Q9. What is the significance of the `this` keyword in JavaScript?
   - The `this` keyword refers to the object it belongs to. In a function, `this` refers to the global object (window in a browser).
   - In methods, `this` refers to the object that owns the method. Arrow functions don't have their own `this` but inherit it from the enclosing scope.

### Q10. Explain the event bubbling and capturing in JavaScript.
   - Event capturing is the phase where the event trickles down from the root to the target element.
   - Event bubbling is the phase where the event bubbles up from the target element to the root.

### Q11. What is the purpose of the `setTimeout` function in JavaScript?
   - The `setTimeout` function is used to delay the execution of a function or a piece of code for a specified amount of time (in milliseconds).
   - It's commonly used to create delays in animations, execute code after a certain interval, or simulate asynchronous behavior.

### Q12. How can you handle errors in JavaScript?
   - Errors in JavaScript can be handled using `try`, `catch`, `finally` blocks.
   - The `try` block contains the code to be executed, and if an error occurs, it jumps to the `catch` block.
   - The `finally` block is executed regardless of whether an error occurred or not.

### Q13. Explain the concept of Promises in JavaScript.
   - Promises are objects representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation.
   - They have states: `pending`, `fulfilled`, and `rejected`. Promises simplify asynchronous code and make it more readable.

### Q14. What is the difference between `null` and `undefined` in JavaScript?
   - **`null`:** It represents the intentional absence of any object value. It must be assigned.
   - **`undefined`:** It represents an uninitialized or unassigned value. Variables that are not assigned a value are `undefined`.

### Q15. How can you achieve inheritance in JavaScript?
   - Inheritance in JavaScript is achieved through prototype chaining. Objects can inherit properties and methods from other objects by setting their prototype.
   - The `Object.create()` method is commonly used to create an object with a specific prototype.

### Q16. Explain the concept of hoisting in JavaScript.
   - Hoisting is a JavaScript behavior where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope during the compilation phase.
   - Variables declared with `var` are hoisted and initialized with `undefined`. Function declarations are fully hoisted.

### Q17. What is the role of the `document.write()` method?
   - The `document.write()` method is used to write HTML expressions or JavaScript code to a document.
   - It is typically used for testing and dynamically generating content, but it can cause issues with the document structure if used after the page has loaded.

### Q18. How does the `localStorage` differ from `sessionStorage` in JavaScript?
   - **`localStorage`:** Data stored in `localStorage` persists even after the browser is closed. It has no expiration time.
   - **`sessionStorage`:** Data stored in `sessionStorage` is limited to the duration of the page session. It is cleared when the page session ends.

### Q19. What is the purpose of the `JSON.stringify()` method?
   - The `JSON.stringify()` method converts a JavaScript object or value to a JSON string.
   - It is commonly used to send data to a server or to store data in a format that can be easily transmitted between different platforms.

### Q20. Explain the concept of the same-origin policy in JavaScript.
   - The same-origin policy is a security measure that restricts a web page from making requests to a different domain than the one that served the web page.
   - It prevents malicious scripts from making requests on behalf of the user without their consent.
