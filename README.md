# Questions and Answers

### Q1. What are the different data types in JavaScript?

JavaScript supports two broad categories of data types:

#### âœ… Primitive Data Types:
- **String**, **Number**, **Boolean**, **null**, **undefined**, **Symbol**, **BigInt**

#### âœ… Non-Primitive (Reference) Data Types:
- **Object**, **Array**, **Function**

```js
// Primitive types
let name = "John";     // String
let age = 30;          // Number
let isLoggedIn = true; // Boolean
let nothing = null;    // null
let notDefined;        // undefined

// Non-primitive types
let person = { name: "Alice", age: 25 }; // Object
let colors = ["red", "blue"];            // Array
let greet = function() { console.log("Hi"); }; // Function
```

### Q2. What is the difference between `var`, `let`, and `const`?
   - **`let`:** It allows the declaration of block-scoped variables. The variable can be reassigned within the same block.
   - **`const`:** It also declares block-scoped variables but is used for constants that cannot be reassigned.
   - **`var`:** It declares a variable globally or locally to the entire function, regardless of block scope. It can be reassigned.
   - Example:
        ```
        function testVar() {
           if (true) {
             var x = 1;
           }
           console.log(x); // 1 (var is function-scoped)
         }

         function testLet() {
           if (true) {
             let y = 2;
           }
           // console.log(y); // Error! y is block-scoped
         }

         const z = 3;
         // z = 4; // Error! Cannot re-assign const

        ```

### Q3. What are primitive vs non-primitive types?

   - ðŸ“Œ Primitive Types:

      Store actual value
      Immutable (cannot be changed)
      Examples: String, Number, Boolean, null, undefined, Symbol, BigInt

   - ðŸ“Œ Non-Primitive Types:

      Store reference to value
      Mutable (can be changed)
      Examples: Object, Array, Function
    - Example:
        ```
        let a = "hello"; // primitive
      let b = { msg: "hi" }; // non-primitive
      
      let c = b;
      c.msg = "hello again";
      console.log(b.msg); // Output: "hello again"
        ```
   - [Back to Top](#javascript-interview-questions)

### Q4. What is hoisting in JavaScript?

Hoisting is JavaScript's behavior of moving variable and function declarations to the top of their scope during the compile phase.

- var is hoisted and initialized as undefined

- let and const are hoisted but not initialized

- Function declarations are hoisted completely (code + definition)

    - Example:
        ```
        console.log(a); // undefined
        var a = 5;

        console.log(b); // ReferenceError
        let b = 10;

        greet(); // "Hello"
        function greet() {
        console.log("Hello");
        }

        ```

   - [Back to Top](#javascript-interview-questions)

### Q5. What is the difference between regular functions and arrow functions?
ðŸ“Œ Regular Functions

- Have their own this context
- Can access arguments object
- Can be used as constructors
- Are hoisted

ðŸ“Œ Arrow Functions

- Donâ€™t have their own this, they inherit it from their parent scope
- Donâ€™t have arguments object
- Cannot be used as constructors
- Not hoisted

    - Example:
        ```
        // Regular function
        function sayHello() {
        console.log("Hello from regular function");
        }

        // Arrow function
        const sayHi = () => {
        console.log("Hello from arrow function");
        }

        // `this` behavior
        const person = {
        name: "Alice",
        regularFunc: function () {
            console.log(this.name); // Alice
        },
        arrowFunc: () => {
            console.log(this.name); // undefined
        }
        };

        person.regularFunc();
        person.arrowFunc();


        ```

### Q6. What is a closure? How does it work?
   - A closure is a function that remembers the variables from its outer lexical scope, even after the outer function has completed execution.
   - This means a function can "close over" its surrounding scope and still access those variables later.

   - Example:
        ```
        function outer() {
            let count = 0;
            return function inner() {
                count++;
                console.log("Count:", count);
            };
        }

        const counter = outer();
        counter(); // Count: 1
        counter(); // Count: 2
        ```

- Here, inner() is a closure â€” it keeps access to count even after outer() has finished.
   - [Back to Top](#javascript-interview-questions)

### Q7. What is the difference between call(), apply(), and bind() in JavaScript?
   - call: Calls a function with a specified this and arguments provided individually.

   - apply: Similar to call, but arguments are provided as an array.

   - bind: Returns a new function, with this set, without invoking immediately.
   - Example:
        ```
        const person = {
        name: "Alice",
        greet: function(city) {
            console.log(`Hello, I'm ${this.name} from ${city}`);
        }
        };

        const anotherPerson = { name: "Bob" };

        person.greet.call(anotherPerson, "Mumbai"); // Hello, I'm Bob from Mumbai
        person.greet.apply(anotherPerson, ["Delhi"]); // Hello, I'm Bob from Delhi

        const boundGreet = person.greet.bind(anotherPerson, "Pune");
        boundGreet(); // Hello, I'm Bob from Pune

        ```
   - [Back to Top](#javascript-interview-questions)

### Q8. What is IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression)?
   - An IIFE is a function that runs as soon as it is defined. It is often used to avoid polluting the global scope or to create private variables.
   - Example:
        ```
        (function () {
            let message = "This runs immediately!";
            console.log(message);
        })(); // Output: This runs immediately!

        ```
   - [Back to Top](#javascript-interview-questions)

### Q9. How to create objects in JavaScript?
   - There are several ways to create objects:
   âœ… Object Literal
   - Example:
     ```
            const person = { name: "Alice", age: 25 };

     ```
   âœ… Constructor Function
   - Example:
     ```
            function Person(name, age) {
                this.name = name;
                this.age = age;
            }
            const user = new Person("Bob", 30);

     ```
   âœ… Object.create()
  - Example:
     ```
            const proto = { greet: function() { console.log("Hello"); } };
            const obj = Object.create(proto);
            obj.greet(); // Hello
     ```
   âœ… Class Syntax (ES6)
   - Example:
     ```
            class Person {
                constructor(name, age) {
                    this.name = name;
                    this.age = age;
                }
            }
            const user = new Person("Charlie", 40);
     ```

### q10. What is the difference between == and ===?
   - == (loose equality) compares two values for equality after converting both values to a common type (type coercion).

   - === (strict equality) checks for both value and type â€” no type conversion is performed.
   - Example:
     ```
           console.log(2 == "2");   // true  (string "2" is converted to number)
           console.log(2 === "2");  // false (types are different)
           console.log(null == undefined);  // true (special case)
           console.log(null === undefined); // false
     ```
   - [Back to Top](#javascript-interview-questions)

### Q11. What are JavaScript array methods like map(), filter(), reduce(), find(), etc.?
- map creates a new array by applying a function to each element.

- filter returns a new array with elements that pass a test function.

- reduce reduces the array to a single value by accumulating results.

- find returns the first element that satisfies a test function.
- Example:
     ```
        const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

        // map
        const doubled = arr.map(x => x * 2); // [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

        // filter
        const evens = arr.filter(x => x % 2 === 0); // [2, 4]

        // reduce
        const sum = arr.reduce((acc, curr) => acc + curr, 0); // 15

        // find
        const firstEven = arr.find(x => x % 2 === 0); // 2

     ```

### Q12. What are callbacks? How do they work?
   - A callback is a function passed as an argument to another function, to be executed after some operation completes (often asynchronously).
   - Example:
     ```
       function fetchData(callback) {
        setTimeout(() => {
            callback("Data loaded");
        }, 1000);
        }

        fetchData(function(result) {
            console.log(result); // "Data loaded" (after 1s)
        });
     ```
   - Callbacks are core to handling asynchronous tasks in JavaScript (timers, I/O, events, etc.).
   - [Back to Top](#javascript-interview-questions)

### Q13. What are Promises? How are they better than callbacks?

- A Promise is an object representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation. Promises help you avoid deeply nested callbacks (callback hell) and provide better error handling.

âœ… Benefits over callbacks:
- Avoids callback nesting (callback hell)
- Better error handling with .catch()
- Easier to compose multiple async tasks

- [Back to Top](#javascript-interview-questions)

### Q14. What is async/await? How is it better than .then()?
   - async/await is syntactic sugar over Promises in JavaScript. It makes asynchronous code look and behave like synchronous code, improving readability and maintainability.

   - **async:** Declares a function as asynchronous. It returns a promise.
   - **await:** Pauses the execution of an async function until the promise is resolved or rejected.

   - Example:
     ```
       // Using .then()
            fetch("https://api.example.com/data")
            .then(res => res.json())
            .then(data => console.log(data))
            .catch(err => console.error(err));

            // Using async/await
            async function getData() {
            try {
                const res = await fetch("https://api.example.com/data");
                const data = await res.json();
                console.log(data);
            } catch (err) {
                console.error(err);
            }
            }
            getData();
     ```

   âœ… Readability:
- Code written with async/await is often easier to read and write than chaining multiple .then() calls, especially for sequential asynchronous steps.

âœ… Error Handling:
- You can use try/catch with async/await just like synchronous code.

- [Back to Top](#javascript-interview-questions)

### Q15. What is the Event Loop in JavaScript?
- The Event Loop is a mechanism in JavaScript that handles asynchronous operations like callbacks, promises, and events.

- JavaScript is single-threaded, but it uses the event loop to manage tasks asynchronously without blocking the main thread.
ðŸŒ€ Flow:

- Executes code from the call stack.
- Sends async tasks to Web APIs (e.g., setTimeout, fetch).
- Once done, the callback gets queued in task queues (macro/micro).
- The event loop checks the call stack. If it's empty, it moves tasks from the queue to the call stack.

- [Back to Top](#javascript-interview-questions)

### Q16. Explain microtask vs macrotask queue.
   - Microtask queue: Used for tasks like resolved Promises and MutationObservers.
    - Executes after the current script but before any macrotask (like a timer or event).

- Macrotask queue: Used for timers (setTimeout, setInterval), UI events, I/O, etc.

**Execution Order:**
 After every synchronous code block, all microtasks are run, then the first macrotask is processed, then microtasks again, and so on.
- Example:
     ```
       console.log('Start');
        setTimeout(() => console.log('Macrotask'), 0); // macrotask
        Promise.resolve().then(() => console.log('Microtask')); // microtask
        console.log('End');

        // Output:
        // Start
        // End
        // Microtask
        // Macrotask

     ```
- [Back to Top](#javascript-interview-questions)

### Q17. What are setTimeout, setInterval, and clearTimeout?
   - setTimeout(fn, delay): Runs a function once after a delay (in ms).

- setInterval(fn, delay): Runs a function repeatedly with a fixed delay between runs.

- clearTimeout(id) / clearInterval(id): Stops an active scheduled timeout or interval, using the ID returned by setTimeout/setInterval.
   - Example:
     ```
       // setTimeout
        const timeoutId = setTimeout(() => {
        console.log("Runs once after 1 second");
        }, 1000);

        // setInterval
        const intervalId = setInterval(() => {
        console.log("Runs every 2 seconds");
        }, 2000);

        // clearInterval/clearTimeout
        clearTimeout(timeoutId);    // Cancels the scheduled timeout
        clearInterval(intervalId);  // Cancels the setInterval
     ```
- [Back to Top](#javascript-interview-questions)

### Q18. What is callback hell and how do you avoid it?
   - Callback Hell refers to nested callbacks that make code hard to read and maintain.
   - Example:
     ```
      // Callback Hell
        loginUser("user", () => {
        fetchProfile(() => {
            loadDashboard(() => {
            console.log("Dashboard loaded");
            });
        });
        });

     ```
- How to avoid callback hell?
    - Use Promises: Enables chaining and flattens the code.
    - Use async/await: Makes async code look synchronous.
    - Use named functions instead of inline.

### Q19. What is the DOM? How do you manipulate it with JS?

- The **DOM (Document Object Model)** is a programming interface that represents the structure of an HTML document as a tree of objects.
- JavaScript uses the DOM to dynamically access and manipulate elements, attributes, and styles on a web page.
- Example :
```
// Accessing an element
const heading = document.getElementById("title");

// Changing text content
heading.textContent = "Hello World";

// Changing styles
heading.style.color = "blue";

// Creating and appending elements
const newPara = document.createElement("p");
newPara.textContent = "I was added using JS!";
document.body.appendChild(newPara);
```

### Q20. What are event bubbling and event capturing?

- Event Bubbling: Events start from the innermost element and bubble up to its ancestors.

- Event Capturing (Trickling): Events are first captured by the outermost ancestor and propagated inward.

- [Back to Top](#javascript-interview-questions)

### Q21. What are localStorage, sessionStorage, and cookies?
- localStorage : Stores data in the browser with no expiration. Survives page reloads and browser restarts.

- sessionStorage : Stores data for the current session only. Data is cleared when the page or browser is closed.

- Cookies : Small data pieces sent to and from the server with every HTTP request, can have an expiration date, and are accessible from both client and optionally the server.
- Example:
     ```
     // localStorage
      localStorage.setItem("name", "John");
      console.log(localStorage.getItem("name"));
      
      // sessionStorage
      sessionStorage.setItem("temp", "123");
      
      // cookies
      document.cookie = "user=John; expires=Fri, 1 Aug 2025 12:00:00 UTC";
     ```
- [Back to Top](#javascript-interview-questions)

### Q22. What is the `this` keyword and how does it behave in different contexts?

- The this keyword refers to the execution context (the object that owns the current code). Its value depends on how a function is called:

   - Global context: In the browser, this refers to the window object. In strict mode or Node.js global scope, it's undefined.

   - Object method: this refers to the object before the dot.

   - Constructor: Inside a constructor function/class, this refers to the newly created instance.

   - Arrow functions: Do not have their own this; they inherit from the outer (lexical) context.

- [Back to Top](#javascript-interview-questions)

### Q23. What is destructuring in JavaScript (arrays/objects)?

- Destructuring is a syntax for extracting values from arrays or objects into distinct variables, making code cleaner and more concise.

- [Back to Top](#javascript-interview-questions)
  

### Q24. What is middleware in Express.js? How does it work?

- Middleware functions in Express are functions that run during the request-response cycle, between when a request comes in and a response is sent. Middleware has access to req, res, and next and is used for tasks like logging, parsing,  authentication, error handling, etc.

- Global middleware: Applied to all routes using app.use()
- Route middleware: Applied to specific routes or route groups
-  Example:
     ```
    app.use((req, res, next) => {
     console.log(`${req.method} ${req.url}`);
     next(); // Passes control to the next middleware
   });

     ```

### Q25. Explain how you implemented JWT-based authentication in your project.

- After user login or signup, the server issues a JWT (signed with a secret).

- The client includes the JWT in the Authorization header for each protected API request.

- On protected endpoints, you verify the JWT. If valid, allow access; if invalid, reject the request.
-  Example:
     ```
    const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');

        // Generate token after login
        const token = jwt.sign({ userId: user._id }, 'your_jwt_secret', { expiresIn: '1h' });

        // Middleware to protect routes
        function authMiddleware(req, res, next) {
        const token = req.headers.authorization?.split(' ')[1];
        try {
            const decoded = jwt.verify(token, 'your_jwt_secret');
            req.user = decoded;
            next();
        } catch (err) {
            res.status(401).json({ error: 'Invalid token' });
        }
        }

### Q26.Difference between process.nextTick(), setImmediate(), and setTimeout()?
- process.nextTick(): Executes the callback immediately after the current operation, before any I/O or timer events (microtask, highest priority).

- setImmediate(): Executes the callback on the next iteration of the event loop, after any I/O events (macrotask).

- setTimeout(callback, 0): Similar timing to setImmediate but scheduled by the timer phase, may be delayed more.

   - Example:
     ```
        process.nextTick(() => console.log('nextTick'));
        setTimeout(() => console.log('setTimeout'), 0);
        setImmediate(() => console.log('setImmediate'));
        // Output: nextTick, then setTimeout/setImmediate (order may vary)
     ```

### Q27. How do you structure a Node.js project?
   - Separate code into logical folders: routes, controllers, models, middlewares, config

- Use environment variables for secrets (with dotenv)

- Each module/file exports whatâ€™s needed, keeps code maintainable
   - Example:
     ```
      /project-root
        /routes
            user.js
        /controllers
            userController.js
        /models
            User.js
        /middlewares
            auth.js
        app.js
        .env
        package.json

     ```

### Q28. How do you handle errors in Express?

- For synchronous errors, use try/catch in route handlers

- For async errors, use next(err) to pass them to error-handling middleware

- Create a centralized error handler that responds to the client and logs errors
- Example :
```
// Centralized error handler
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  console.error(err.stack);
  res.status(500).json({ message: err.message });
});

```

### Q29. How do you define a model using Mongoose?

- Define a schema, then create a model with Mongoose:

- Example :
```
const mongoose = require('mongoose');
const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  username: { type: String, required: true, unique: true },
  password: { type: String, required: true }
});
const User = mongoose.model('User', userSchema);

module.exports = User;


```

### Q30. Explain MongoDB aggregation pipeline stages.
- Aggregation pipelines process data through multiple stages.

- $match filters docs, $group aggregates, $lookup joins.

- Example:
     ```
     [
        { $match: { status: 'active' } },
        { $group: { _id: '$department', total: { $sum: 1 } } },
        { $lookup: {
            from: 'departments', 
            localField: '_id', 
            foreignField: 'name', 
            as: 'departmentDetails'
            } 
        }
    ]

     ```

### Q31. How do you secure a Node.js backend application?

- Use environment variables, donâ€™t commit secrets
- Validate and sanitize all user input
- Use HTTPS
- Limit rate (express-rate-limit), helmet for HTTP headers
- Keep dependencies updated (npm audit)
- Use proper authentication & authorization
- Sanitize database queries (e.g., use parameterized queries)

### Q33. What are streams in Node.js?

- Streams let you read, write, or transform data piece by piece, not all at once (efficient for big files, network, video/audio).

- Readable, Writable, Duplex, Transform streams support various types of data flow.
- Used for file I/O, HTTP requests/responses, real-time data.
-  Example:
     ```
    const fs = require('fs');
    const stream = fs.createReadStream('large.txt');
    stream.on('data', chunk => console.log('Received chunk', chunk));
    ```

### Q34.How does the Node.js event loop work?

- Node.js uses an event loop with phases:

    1. Timers: Executes setTimeout/setInterval callbacks

    2. Pending Callbacks: I/O callbacks deferred to the next loop

    3. Idle, Prepare: Internal use

    4. Poll: Retrieves new I/O events, executes I/O-related callbacks

    5. Check: Executes setImmediate callbacks

    6. Close Callbacks: Executes close events

 In between, microtasks like process.nextTick and resolved Promises execute..

### Q35. How do you test your APIs?

- Manual testing: Use Postman/Insomnia to send requests, check responses.

- Automated testing: Use Jest/Supertest for integration tests.
-  Example:
     ```
    const request = require('supertest');
    const app = require('./app');

    test('GET /users returns 200', async () => {
    await request(app)
        .get('/users')
        .expect(200);
    });

    ```

### Q36. How would you scale a Node.js app for high traffic?

- Clustering: Use Node.js cluster module/PM2 to use multiple CPU cores.

- Load balancer: Use Nginx, HAProxy, or a cloud LB to distribute requests across multiple Node.js instances/servers.

- Horizontal scaling: Deploy multiple instances, possibly on Kubernetes/Docker.

- Stateless app: Avoid in-memory sessions; use Redis or database for session store.

- Caching: Use Redis/memcached to cache results and reduce DB load.

- Monitor and auto-scale: Use tools (NewRelic, AWS CloudWatch) to monitor and auto-scale based on traffic
